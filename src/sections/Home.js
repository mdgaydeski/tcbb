            <h1>Twin Cities Brass Band</h1>
            <Carousel />
            <p>The Twin Cities Brass Band is an English-style brass band based in the heart of Minnesota. The TCBB has performed at various music festivals around the Twin Cities Metro, as well as at educational events. We put on traditional concerts throughout the year, bringing the grandeur and virtuosity of brass band music to audiences both young and old.</p>
            <p>We have a partnership with St. Michael's Lutheran Church in Bloomington, where we hold regular rehearsals on Thursday evenings as well as many of our concerts.</p>
